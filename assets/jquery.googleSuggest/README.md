Since this plugin builds on top of [jQueryUI's autocomplete](http://jqueryui.com/demos/autocomplete/) widget,
pretty much all of autocomplete's options/events are applies to it as well,
with the exception of `source`.

Google Suggest for jQuery itself has 2 options: service and secure.

Options:
========

| option  | type    | default | note
|---------|---------|---------|-----
| service | string  | ""      | It's used to specify what Google service to query against. It can be `web`, `youtube`, `products`, `books`, `news`, `images`, `recipes`, or "" (empty string). By default it queries Google's web auto suggestions (the `web` option).
| secure  | boolean | false   | It's used to specify whether to use HTTPS or not. By default it doesn't use secure connection.

Example: 
========

    //uses default settings
    $("#selector").googleSuggest(); 

    //uses HTTPS
    $("#selector").googleSuggest({secure: true});

    //queries Google Products
    $("#selector").googleSuggest({service: "products"});

    //alerts the selected value
    $("#selector").googleSuggestion({select: function(event, ui){ alert(ui.item.value); }});

You can access the autocomplete settings directly.

    $("selector").autocomplete("option", "disable");
